# fantasyrowingcollege

Quick guide to the repo:

- All python in the main directory is the code I'm working on right now. Atm it's code that ranks all the players according to their results over the season
- In the other directories I have old code that I had been working on relating to this project. Some of it I plan to return two (schedule generator, rower database etc.) some I do not (elo ratings, python drafting system etc.)
- I don't guarantee any of the old code will work without some minor tweaks to the imports and whatnot but the code in the main directory should work fine

So this is my college rowing fantasy code. It's kind of a mish mash at this point but I'd love to start developing it into a website soon.

The points formula document is just a sketchpad for my ideas on how to develop points for each athlete after each race and it's not particularly scientific or fleshed out yet although the formula there right now seems to work well for what I'm looking for.

Take a glance if you want, if you have any questions on certain aspects of the code/formula message me and I'll get back to you.
