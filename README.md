Quick guide to the repo:

-Ira results is just a collection of pdf results from previous years IRA championships

-Ivy results and Pac-12 results are a currently empty set of files that would hold the racing results from various years of those conferences

-Roster files are the html pages for the rosters of the 24 IRA schools that competed in the mens V8 at IRA's

-Sql just contains some test databases I was fooling around with while figuring out sqlite3

-The big crews contains a spreadsheet with some pretty fleshed out race results from many teams in the IRA over the 2014-2015 season. It was all typed in by hand and was a bitch to compile. In the spreadsheet there is also the elo ratings over the course of the seasons for these teams

-The code is in .py files, the databases are .db, there is a graphic of the elo ratings of various teams during the season as a .png and a scratch word file I was using to test formula stuff as a .docx

So this is all my college fantasy rowing code atm. It's a mish mash of really ugly elo rating coding that I did a while ago as an experiment and a little more refined roster scraping code that I recently did.

The points formula document is just a sketchpad for my ideas on how to develop points for each athlete after each race and it's not particularly scientific or fleshed out yet.

For anyone who wants to take this code and use it or, god forbid, try to learn from it, feel free. MIT License or whatever.
