So this is all my code college fantasy rowing code atm. It's a mish mash of really ugly elo rating coding that I did a while ago as an experiment and a little more refined roster scraping code that I recently did.

The points formula document is just a sketchpad for my ideas on how to develop points for each athlete after each race and it's not particularly scientific or fleshed out yet.

For anyone who wants to take this code and use it or, god forbid, try to learn from it, feel free. MIT License or whatever.
